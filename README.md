# Employee Manager

This project adheres to the code structure guidelines of Robert "Uncle Bob" Martin's clean code principles. It focuses on key aspects such as meaningful naming, adhering to the "one purpose one function" rule, error handling, and unit testing.

The project implements an approach utilizing creational patterns, including factory methods and the builder pattern. These patterns are employed in the creation of employees.

Additionally, the project incorporates a fluent interface, specifically the builder pattern, to provide a more intuitive and readable code structure.

The project also utilizes Lombok, a library that helps reduce boilerplate code in Java classes, improving overall code conciseness and maintainability.
